# Python Tools

This folder contains python tools to analyze Nightscout data.

Remember to run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The Nightscout reports are generated by having Loop respond to an input data set of CGM values.

Other folders in this repository:

* ../input_files: glucose input patterns
* ../shell_scripts:
    * upload a pattern to Nightscout
    * download devicestatus and treatment data from Nightscout

The python program is in very early (all-in-one-file) prototype format.

The command line arguments expected are:

* path: path used to read data and write analysis results
* devicestatus: downloaded text filename
* treatments: downloaded text filename
* label: (optional, default is read from Note in Nightscout devicestatus)
* output_summary.csv: (optional, default path/glucose_impulse_response.csv)
