# Python Tools

This folder contains python tools to analyze Nightscout data.

Remember to run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The Nightscout reports are generated by having Loop respond to an input data set of CGM values.

Other folders in this repository:

* ../input_files: glucose input patterns
* ../shell_scripts:
    * upload a pattern to Nightscout
    * download devicestatus and treatment data from Nightscout

The python program is in very early (all-in-one-file) prototype format.

The command line arguments expected are:

Usage:
  python glucose_test.py arg1 arg2 [arg3] [arg4]
    arg1 - path for data I/O
    arg2 - timestamp identifier (used for I/O)
       input: arg2_devicestatus.txt, arg2_treatments.txt
       output: plot_arg2.png
    arg3 - optional label, otherwise uses note in treatments
    arg4 - optional output filename, otherwise uses glucose_impulse_response.csv
